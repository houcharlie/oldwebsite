title: An Introduction to NBA Analytics
permalink: /blog/:title
---

On this site, I previously had an NBA analytics tutorial. I have since converted my GitHub page into a blog :) 
I spent some time today trying to convert the Jupyter Notebook to markdown and posting it onto here, but I was running into some annoying format issues. So I gave up (for now). You can still access the notebook [here][1].
