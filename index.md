Hi!  I'm currently a senior at Princeton University.  At school, I am working on separate research projects advised by [Yuxin Chen](http://www.princeton.edu/~yc5/) and [Miklos Racz](http://mracz.princeton.edu/).  My interests include optimization, programming, neural networks, control/reinforcement learning, random graphs, and statistical inference.  

Articles I write will be placed in my own [blog](https://houcharlie.github.io/blog/) or on a group research [blog](https://kaledivergence.github.io/) that I've started with a few others.

I also like writing [fiction](https://houcharlie.github.io/stories/) and [cooking](https://youtu.be/ATmsipFdZQ4).

Thanks to Gene Li for letting me use his template!
